## Usage

### deep-filter

Download a pre-compiled deep-filter binary from the [release page](https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet/releases/).
You can use `deep-filter` to suppress noise in noisy .wav audio files. Currently, only wav files with a sampling rate of 48kHz are supported.

```bash
USAGE:
    deep-filter [OPTIONS] [FILES]...

ARGS:
    <FILES>...

OPTIONS:
    -D, --compensate-delay
            Compensate delay of STFT and model lookahead
    -h, --help
            Print help information
    -m, --model <MODEL>
            Path to model tar.gz. Defaults to DeepFilterNet2.
    -o, --out-dir <OUT_DIR>
            [default: out]
    --pf
            Enable postfilter
    -v, --verbose
            Logging verbosity
    -V, --version
            Print version information
```

If you want to use the pytorch backend e.g. for GPU processing, see further below for the Python usage.

### DeepFilterNet Framework

This framework supports Linux, MacOS and Windows. Training is only tested under Linux. The framework is structured as follows:

* `libDF` contains Rust code used for data loading and augmentation.
* `DeepFilterNet` contains DeepFilterNet code training, evaluation and visualization as well as pretrained model weights.
* `pyDF` contains a Python wrapper of libDF STFT/ISTFT processing loop.
* `pyDF-data` contains a Python wrapper of libDF dataset functionality and provides a pytorch data loader.
* `ladspa` contains a LADSPA plugin for real-time noise suppression.
* `models` contains pretrained for usage in DeepFilterNet (Python) or libDF/deep-filter (Rust)

### DeepFilterNet Python: PyPI

Install the DeepFilterNet Python wheel via pip:
```bash
# Install cpu/cuda pytorch (>=1.8) dependency from pytorch.org, e.g.:
pip install torch torchaudio -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
# Install DeepFilterNet
pip install deepfilternet
# Or install DeepFilterNet including data loading functionality for training (Linux only)
pip install deepfilternet[train]
```

To enhance noisy audio files using DeepFilterNet run
```bash
# Specify an output directory with --output-dir [OUTPUT_DIR]
deepFilter path/to/noisy_audio.wav
```

### Manual Installation

Install cargo via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Usage of a `conda` or `virtualenv` recommended.

Installation of python dependencies and libDF:
```bash
cd path/to/DeepFilterNet/  # cd into repository
# Recommended: Install or activate a python env
# Mandatory: Install cpu/cuda pytorch (>=1.8) dependency from pytorch.org, e.g.:
pip install torch torchaudio -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
# Install build dependencies used to compile libdf and DeepFilterNet python wheels
pip install maturin poetry
# Build and install libdf python package required for enhance.py
maturin develop --release -m pyDF/Cargo.toml
# Optional: Install libdfdata python package with dataset and dataloading functionality for training
# Required build dependency: HDF5 headers (e.g. ubuntu: libhdf5-dev)
maturin develop --release -m pyDF-data/Cargo.toml
# If you have troubles with hdf5 you may try to build and link hdf5 statically:
maturin develop --release --features hdf5-static -m pyDF-data/Cargo.toml
# Install remaining DeepFilterNet python dependencies
cd DeepFilterNet
poetry install -E train -E eval # Note: This globally installs DeepFilterNet in your environment
# Alternatively for developement: Install only dependencies and work with the repository version
poetry install -E train -E eval --no-root
# You may need to set the python path
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
```

### Use DeepFilterNet from command line

To enhance noisy audio files using DeepFilterNet run
```bash
$ python DeepFilterNet/df/enhance.py --help
usage: enhance.py [-h] [--model-base-dir MODEL_BASE_DIR] [--pf] [--output-dir OUTPUT_DIR] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL] [--compensate-delay]
                  noisy_audio_files [noisy_audio_files ...]

positional arguments:
  noisy_audio_files     List of noise files to mix with the clean speech file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --model-base-dir MODEL_BASE_DIR, -m MODEL_BASE_DIR
                        Model directory containing checkpoints and config.
                        To load a pretrained model, you may just provide the model name, e.g. `DeepFilterNet`.
                        By default, the pretrained DeepFilterNet2 model is loaded.
  --pf                  Post-filter that slightly over-attenuates very noisy sections.
  --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR, -o OUTPUT_DIR
                        Directory in which the enhanced audio files will be stored.
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        Logger verbosity. Can be one of (debug, info, error, none)
  --compensate-delay, -D
                        Add some paddig to compensate the delay introduced by the real-time STFT/ISTFT implementation.

# Enhance audio with original DeepFilterNet
python DeepFilterNet/df/enhance.py -m DeepFilterNet path/to/noisy_audio.wav

# Enhance audio with DeepFilterNet2
python DeepFilterNet/df/enhance.py -m DeepFilterNet2 path/to/noisy_audio.wav
```

### Use DeepFilterNet within your Python script

```py
from df import enhance, init_df

model, df_state, _ = init_df()  # Load default model
enhanced_audio = enhance(model, df_state, noisy_audio)
```

See [here](https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet/blob/main/scripts/external_usage.py) for a full example.

### Training

The entry point is `DeepFilterNet/df/train.py`. It expects a data directory containing HDF5 dataset
as well as a dataset configuration json file.

So, you first need to create your datasets in HDF5 format. Each dataset typically only
holds training, validation, or test set of noise, speech or RIRs.
```py
# Install additional dependencies for dataset creation
pip install h5py librosa soundfile
# Go to DeepFilterNet python package
cd path/to/DeepFilterNet/DeepFilterNet
# Prepare text file (e.g. called training_set.txt) containing paths to .wav files
#
# usage: prepare_data.py [-h] [--num_workers NUM_WORKERS] [--max_freq MAX_FREQ] [--sr SR] [--dtype DTYPE]
#                        [--codec CODEC] [--mono] [--compression COMPRESSION]
#                        type audio_files hdf5_db
#
# where:
#   type: One of `speech`, `noise`, `rir`
#   audio_files: Text file containing paths to audio files to include in the dataset
#   hdf5_db: Output HDF5 dataset.
python df/scripts/prepare_data.py --sr 48000 speech training_set.txt TRAIN_SET_SPEECH.hdf5
```
All datasets should be made available in one dataset folder for the train script.

The dataset configuration file should contain 3 entries: "train", "valid", "test". Each of those
contains a list of datasets (e.g. a speech, noise and a RIR dataset). You can use multiple speech
or noise dataset. Optionally, a sampling factor may be specified that can be used to over/under-sample
the dataset. Say, you have a specific dataset with transient noises and want to increase the amount
of non-stationary noises by oversampling. In most cases you want to set this factor to 1.

<details>
  <summary>Dataset config example:</summary>
<p>
  
`dataset.cfg`

```json
{
  "train": [
    [
      "TRAIN_SET_SPEECH.hdf5",
      1.0
    ],
    [
      "TRAIN_SET_NOISE.hdf5",
      1.0
    ],
    [
      "TRAIN_SET_RIR.hdf5",
      1.0
    ]
  ],
  "valid": [
    [
      "VALID_SET_SPEECH.hdf5",
      1.0
    ],
    [
      "VALID_SET_NOISE.hdf5",
      1.0
    ],
    [
      "VALID_SET_RIR.hdf5",
      1.0
    ]
  ],
  "test": [
    [
      "TEST_SET_SPEECH.hdf5",
      1.0
    ],
    [
      "TEST_SET_NOISE.hdf5",
      1.0
    ],
    [
      "TEST_SET_RIR.hdf5",
      1.0
    ]
  ]
}
```

</p>
</details>

Finally, start the training script. The training script may create a model `base_dir` if not
existing used for logging, some audio samples, model checkpoints, and config. If no config file is
found, it will create a default config. See
[DeepFilterNet/pretrained_models/DeepFilterNet](https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet/blob/main/DeepFilterNet/pretrained_models/DeepFilterNet/config.ini)
for a config file.
```py
# usage: train.py [-h] [--debug] data_config_file data_dir base_dir
python df/train.py path/to/dataset.cfg path/to/data_dir/ path/to/base_dir/
```
