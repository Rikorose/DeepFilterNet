# DeepFilterNet Noise Canceling Sink
#
# 1. Copy this file into a conf.d/ directory such as:
#     /etc/pipewire/filter-chain.conf.d/
#     or locally:
#     ~/.config/pipewire/filter-chain.conf.d/
#
# 2. Install the deep_filter plugin globally to:
#     /usr/lib/ladspa/libdeep_filter_ladspa.so
#     or locally:
#     ~/.ladspa/libdeep_filter_ladspa.so
#
# 3. Adjust the plugin path (line 38) accordingly. If you installed the plugin
#     locally in your home directory, make sure to provide an absolute path here
#     (i.e. /home/<your-user-name/.ladspa/) and do not use '~' or '$HOME'!
#
# 4. You may limit the noise attenuation (i.e. don't reduce all noise) by setting
#     'Attenuation Limit (dB)' to a smaller value. For little noise reduction, try
#     6-12, for medium noise reduction 18-24 dB. 100 dB means no attenuation limit.
#
# 5. Run the DeepFilter pipewire filter via `pipewire -c filter-chain.conf`
#
# 6. Select the DeepFilter sink (e.g. in pavucontrol) for an application that
#     currently plays some audio (i.e. Browser, Zoom, Discord, etc.).
#     DeepFilterNet will denoise the application output and will playback the
#     enhanced audio on your default sink (speakers, headphone).
